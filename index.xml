      <description>This is really to just get started, I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything in my mind right now except for thinking about ongoing situation because of the pandemic. Coming to the point I&amp;rsquo;ll document all the major experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve gained involving opensource development, research, and other exciting stuff like game AI, philosophy, and ongoing topics. Till then goodbye&amp;hellip; and stay safe.</description>

      <description>CSE üíª undergrad who&amp;rsquo;s quite passionate about opensource development, data science, and üì± android-app development.
