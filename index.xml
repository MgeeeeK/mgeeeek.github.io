      <description>How this year turned out horrible for all students‚Ä¶ really exciting news at the end though!!! It‚Äôs been a while since I posted or blogged about something. This year is one of the most tragic and hard-hitting for all of us, I don‚Äôt want to stretch over the current situation so let&amp;rsquo;s jump straight on to my worst experience with any semester till now.
The worst thing for me, personally is the ongoing semester which is taking forever to end.</description>

      <description>From now on I&amp;rsquo;ll try to document all the major experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve gained involving opensource development, research work, and exciting stuff like game-theory, python-libraries, Linux-distro-kernel(this is what I come to when I&amp;rsquo;m super bored), philosophy-morality-religion(I&amp;rsquo;m being pretentious now), and most importantly trending topics in the field of AI/ML&amp;hellip; let&amp;rsquo;s leave right here cos I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything in my mind right now except for thinking about the ongoing situation because of the pandemic.</description>

      <description>CSE üíª undergrad who&amp;rsquo;s quite passionate about opensource development, machine learning, and üì± android app-development. I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for new ways to optimize existing solution. My current work revolves around android app-development, recommender systems, and evolutionary computing. Apart from this I&amp;rsquo;m huge fan of thriller/sci-fi/psychological anime, movies, and souls-like üéÆ (really ‚ù§Ô∏è them but no üï¶ to invest üòû).
