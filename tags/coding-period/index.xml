      <description>Phase 1 of the coding period is about to get over and 2 weeks have already passed since I gave an update on my GSoC project. As per my last blog, I successfully implemented the prototype transformation methods of base interface, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the developments happened after first 2 weeks.
Progress on the Project The main goal of the first phase was to implement and finalize the base raster interface, in other words I had to incorporate all methods which can be utilized to make the transformations from xarray.</description>

      <description>Community Bonding period ended on 31st May, I covered my experience with PySAL community during the CB period in my last blog. The coding period has started at the beginning of this month and we’ve already reached midway of the first phase. Through this blog, I’ll share what all I’ve been working on during these couple of weeks.
Overview of 2 Spatial Weight Objects During the community bonding period my focus was to grow my understanding of libpysal&#39;s structure, codebase, and API design paradigms.</description>
