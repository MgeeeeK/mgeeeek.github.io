      <description>Community Bonding period ended on 31st may, I covered my experience with PySAL community during CB period in my last blog. Coding period has already started in the beginning of this month and We&amp;rsquo;ve reached mid way of the first phase. Through this blog I&amp;rsquo;ll share what all I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on during these couple of weeks.
What I did before coding period As stated in the last blog, during community bonding period my focus was to grow my understanding of libpysal&#39;s structure, code base and API design paradigms.</description>
