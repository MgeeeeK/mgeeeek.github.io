      <description>Today marks the end of the community bonding period and the beginning of the coding period of GSoC. In this blog, I&amp;rsquo;ll share my experience with the PySAL community during the community bonding period. The community bonding period is the starting phase in the GSoC timeline which lasts for almost a month. This period is specially designed for students to get introduced to the community and to understand and learn more about the project before the coding period starts.</description>
