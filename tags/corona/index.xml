      <description>How one of the worst semester turned out the absolutely horrible&amp;hellip; really exciting news at the end though!!! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I posted or blogged about something. This year is one of the most tragic and hard-hitting year for all of us, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to stretch over current situation so lets jump straight on to my worst experience with any semester till now.
The worst thing for me, personally is the ongoing semester which is taking forever to end.</description>

      <description>From now on I&amp;rsquo;ll try to document all the major experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve gained involving opensource development, research work, and exciting stuff like game-theory, python-libraries, linux-distro-kernel(this is what I really come to when I&amp;rsquo;m super bored), philosophy-morality-religion(I&amp;rsquo;m being pretentious now), and most importantly trending topics in the field of AI/ML&amp;hellip; lets leave right here cos I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything in my mind right now except for thinking about ongoing situation because of the pandemic.</description>
