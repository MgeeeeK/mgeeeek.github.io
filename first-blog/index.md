From now on I'll **try** to document all the major experiences I've gained involving opensource development, research work, and exciting stuff like game-theory, python-libraries, Linux-distro-kernel(this is what I come to when I'm super bored), philosophy-morality-religion(I'm being pretentious now), and most importantly trending topics in the field of AI/ML... let's leave right here cos I don't have anything in my mind right now except for thinking about the ongoing situation because of the pandemic. I'll also submit my GSoC proposal today (hopefully I'll get selected... oh boy!! super excited for this summer). Till then goodbye, lock yourself at home... and stay safe.
