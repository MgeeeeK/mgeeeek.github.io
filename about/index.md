![lol](/images/photo6170323010582588488.jpg "Thats me")

### Hello! My name is Mragank Shekhar.

I'm a Sofware/Data Engineer who recently graduated from [Bennett University](https://www.bennett.edu.in/), from where I did my bachelors in _Computer Science and Engineering_.

My past experiences include:
1. **Data Engineering Intern @Amazon** (6 Months)
2. **Google Summer of Code 2021 participant with NumFOCUS:ArviZ** (4 Months)
3. **Google Summer of Code 2020 participant with NumFOCUS:PySAL** (4 Months)
4. **Research Intern @NSIT** (2 Months)

I'm quite passionate about **back-end development**, **recommender systems**, and **distributed computing** and I enjoy playing with new tools and technologies. You'll always find me exploring new ways to optimize existing solution.

Apart from this I’m huge fan :heart: of thriller/sci-fi/psychological anime, manga, movies, and souls-like video-games.
